# Code Refactor
For this assignment, I was given an HTML file, CSS stylesheet, and a folder of images for a working website. The task was to refactor the existing code to make it more accessible, cleaner, and easier to read.

## Client Requests
 - Use semantic HTML elements
 - Ensure elements follow a logical structure
 - Ensure all images have alt text for accessibility and search engine optimization
 - Ensure the HTML and CSS files follow an order that makes sense

## Changes Made
 - Replaced `<div>` tags with classes like `.header` and `.footer` with semantic HTML elements where appropriate (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`)
 - Fixed broken navigation link in the header
 - Combined `.search-engine-optimization`, `.online-reputation-management`, and `.social-media-marketing` into one class called `.service`
 - Combined `.benefit-lead`, `.benefit-brand`, and `.benefit-cost` into one class called `.benefit`,
 - Added alt text to all `<img>` tags
 - Reordered elements and classes in CSS file for clarity
 - Added comments throughout the HTML and CSS files to clarify page structure
